##Implement model
Implement this model of forest growth (where forest size in measured in units of carbon (C))
  dC/dt = r ∗ C for forests where C is below a threshold canopy closure
  dC/dt = g ∗ (1 − C/K) for forests where carbon is at or above the threshold canopy closure

K is a carrying capacity in units of carbon, and e forest (C), Canopy closure threshold and carrying capacity are all in units of carbon
